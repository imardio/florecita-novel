# florecita-novel
A ren'py-based visual novel of my son's favourite bedtime story.

This is a short, wholesome story where a lost farm animal meets some friends while searching for her family.
It's a simple tale, meant to be traversed back and forth.
There is a branching point at the end, where the kid [my son :)] must decide whether it's time to sleep or to continue playing with some more farm animals.

It is meant for Android devices.
